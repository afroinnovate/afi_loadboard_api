The Auth.API was created off of .NET 7 and has the following core dependencies:

- `.NET Core SDK 3.1`: The software development kit for .NET Core.
- `.NET 7`: 
- `Entity framework`: A micro ORM for .NET. It simplifies data access and is highly performant.
- `Npgsql`: .NET data provider for PostgreSQL.
- ... _(Include other specific packages or libraries as necessary)_

The Auth.Min.API was created off of .NET 8 with minimal API and has the following core dependencies:

- `.NET Core SDK 3.1`: The software development kit for .NET Core.
- `.NET 8`: 
- `Entity framework`: A micro ORM for .NET. It simplifies data access and is highly performant.

## How to run the app using docker.
### Dependencies.
    Create .env on the root folder and add  following values to it. filling in appropriate values.
    DB_PASSWORD="your-server-password"
    DB_USERNAME="postgres"
    AUTH_DB_NAME=User
    FRIEGHT_DB_NAME=LoadBoard
    DB_HOST=host.docker.internal - This is required when you're running on docker

1. Make sure if you're just starting run the migration - ```dotnet ef migrations add pgInitial -o Infrastructure/Data/Migrations``` - for Freight API

2. 1. Make sure if you're just starting run the migration - ```dotnet ef migrations add pgInitial``` - for Auth API

3. try to update your local db with an outstanding migration for each project ```dotnet ef database update```

**Run the APIs**

1. on the root folder
2. To build the image ```docker compose build``` optional
3. run run the api ```docker-compose -f dev-docker-compose.yaml up```
Access the apis 
- ```localhost:8080/swagger/index.html``` for Authapi
- ```localhost:7070/swagger/index.html``` for Load and Carrier API


### Run it locally without docker
- Make sure you create appsettings.json file in the service you're trying to run, example in Auth.Min.API I can fill in the contents like.
